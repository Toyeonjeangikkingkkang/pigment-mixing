Mixbox is a pigment mixing black-box. You pass RGB colors in and get the mixed RGB out.
Internally, Mixbox treats the colors as if they were made of actual real-world pigments.
It uses the Kubelka & Munk theory to predict the color of the resulting mixture.
This way, Mixbox achieves that blue and yellow mix to green, the same way real pigments do.

Mixbox is shipping in Rebelle 5 Pro as the [Rebelle Pigments](https://www.escapemotions.com/products/rebelle/about), Procreate 5.2 as the [Procreate Pigments](https://procreate.art/) feature.

## Usage
The simplest way to use Mixbox is with the *lerp* interface:
```c++
#include <stdio.h>
#include "mixbox.h"

int main()
{
  unsigned char r1=252, g1=211, b1=0;  // bright yellow
  unsigned char r2=0,   g2=0,   b2=96; // deep blue
  float t = 0.5;
  unsigned char r,g,b;
  
  mixbox_lerp_srgb8(r1,g1,b1,   // first color
                    r2,g2,b2,   // second color
                    t,          // mixing ratio
                    &r,&g,&b);  // result

  printf("%d %d %d\n",r,g,b);
}
```
Alternatively, one can use the *latent* interface. This allows mixing multiple RGB colors at once using arbitrary weights:

```c++
float latent1[MIXBOX_NUMLATENTS];
float latent2[MIXBOX_NUMLATENTS];
float latentMix[MIXBOX_NUMLATENTS];

mixbox_srgb8_to_latent(r1,g1,b1,latent1);
mixbox_srgb8_to_latent(r2,g2,b2,latent2);

for(int i=0;i<MIXBOX_NUMLATENTS;i++)
{ 
  latentMix[i] = (1.0f-t)*latent1[i] + t*latent2[i]; 
}

mixbox_latent_to_srgb8(latentMix,&r,&g,&b);  
```

This is a toy painting app with soft round brush and a smudge tool. It runs two color mixing implementations in parallel: one based on Mixbox and the other that performs ordinary RGB mixing. The app allows switching between them on the fly, showing the differences between pigment-based mixing and the normal RGB mixing.
